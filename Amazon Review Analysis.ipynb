    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze customer reviews of different headphones listings on Amazon. The reviews will be split into \"good\" and \"bad\" sets, and the review texts will be processed into tokens consisting of individual words. These will form the \"good\" and \"bad\" review corpuses that will be analyzed to determine the most important words in either good and bad review sets. They will also be used to predict if a review will be \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis has many real-world applications. While customers can manually include ratings for the product in their reviews, this rating is only an overall statement"

Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic.

This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\n",

The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day.

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\n",

Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.\n",

And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\n",

This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\n",

Straps is good quality and the earphones wires are too good...

The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better. I use my earphones a lot for voice calls and this doesn’t let me down at all.  This is a must buy for all music lovers.\n",

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\n",

Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.\n",

And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\n",

This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\n",

Straps is good quality and the earphones wires are too good...

The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better. I use my earphones a lot for voice calls and this doesn’t let me down at all.  This is a must buy for all music lovers.\n",

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\n",

Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.\n",

And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\n",

       "1     No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic.

       "13    Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise.

       "16    Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice.

       "20    he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day.

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives.

       " Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\n",

Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me.

       " Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.\n",

And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache.

       " he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\n",

       " i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go. So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\n",

The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day.

       " I can’t get enough of this earphone! The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better.

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives.

Loud and Super BASS.\n",
       " Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\n",

Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me.

       " Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.\n",

And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache.

       " he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\n",

The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day.

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives.

Loud and Super BASS.\n",
       " Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\n",

Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me.

       " Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.\n",

And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache.

       " he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\n",

Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic.

So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "13    Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "16    Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice.

       "20    he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "26    I just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really Awesome. Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "1     Honest review of an edm music lover\\n No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "13    Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.\\n Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "16    Good Earphones with good sound quality and build quality\\n Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice.

       "20    Overall good but not that worth\\n he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Beyond my expectations.Sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.And coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.I will say,Go for it.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

    "###  Conclusions from the initial analysis of good/bad reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The most notable finding is that \"good\" is ranked as the most important term in both good and bad reviews. This is unexpected, considering that customers who leave bad reviews wouldn't normally conclude that the item was \"good.\" There are two likely reasons for this discrepancy\n",
    "* The bad reviews include 3-star reviews which fall in the middle of the spectrum - some aspects of the product may be good, but overall, the customer was disappointed\n",
    "* These reviews may be about how a product is actually \"not good\" instead of \"good\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting conclusion is how there are more important words in the bad review set than there are in the good review set (138 vs 114). Considering how the bad review set included only 34.4% of the total reviews, I would have expected fewer words in the bad review DTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation is that people tend to be more comprehensive when leaving bad reviews\n",
    "* Many good reviews focus on customer sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Just go for it\\n **Awesome best budget** wireless earphones\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    ">'**SUPERB**\\n **Sound quality is good**. noise cancellation is not upto the mark. **battery quality is decent**. by charging it once you can enjoy upto 5hrs of music without any issue\\n'\n",
    "* Bad reviews are often more detailed to emphasize discontent\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Honest review of an edm music lover\\n No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following **dissapointed** me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.**Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic**. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Review update - **Product failed after a few months**\\n Update: Sadly this is the **second Boat product to conk off after few months of use**. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, **not buying any more products from your brand**. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• **The sound is nothing great**, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. **The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird**. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• **Battery life is nothing to write home about** – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!\\n'\n",

    "### Adjusting the weights according to importance in good/bad reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the first issue where \"good\" seemed prominent in bad reviews, I will adjust the term weighting for shared terms. I will perform this adjustment on the final weight values for easier implementation as otherwise I would most likely need to formulate an entirely different weighting scheme and implement it on the DTM step.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will extract a list of all shared terms and multiply the good/bad weights by the proportion of the total weight in the good/bad DTM. For example, 'good' has 899.2391 weight in the good DTM and 334.82858 in the bad DTM. \n",

    "|Term  |Good    |Bad      |Total     |\n",

    "|Nice  |899.2391|334.82858|1234.06768|\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation used to calculate the updated weights is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Weight_{new} = Weight * \\frac{Weight}{Total}$$\n",

    "By adding a weight to punish words shared between sets based on the relative proportion of total importance between sets, the resulting list of important words is much more indicative of review content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good reviews have a lot shared words at the top of the list ('good', 'best', 'product') while the bad reviews have more unique words at the top ('bad', 'worst', 'work').\n",
    "\n",
    "The good reviews mainly had words indicating customer sentiment, though there were a few words noting physical features ('sound', 'batteri', 'bass'). The bad reviews similarly had customer sentiment terms, but they included more words noting physical features. These include the aforementioned words from the good reviews, but also include words like 'mic', 'connect', 'call'. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting unique term from the top of the bad review DTM is 'month.' This is likely referring to the one month return policy on Amazon, or that the product may have stopped working after a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predicting Review Type\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if these extracted words can accurately predict whether a review is good or bad, I will build a model using the dataset. I will build an SVM model which is typically effective for text mining applications (especially when the feature count is very high).\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the work, I will not perform the weighting adjustment for words shared between good and bad reviews - for the SVM, this will require customizing a weighting scheme.\n",

    "The model performed fairly well - it has an overall 91.46% accuracy, though its accuracy for predicting bad reviews was much lower at 84.08%. This is most likely due to the fact that there are only about half as many bad review examples as good review examples. Also, no adjustments to the term weights was performed - as seen in the previous analysis, many indicative words from the bad review set were shared with the good review set, likely confusing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the model had relatively high marks, with an fscore for the good reviews of 93.64%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could be further improved to increase accuracy. As discovered in the data analysis, the corpuses for both good and bad reviews share a lot of words, including some of the most \"important\" words resulting from the TF-IDF weighting. Customizing a weighting scheme that would lessen the importance of words that are shared between corpuses may improve accuracy as these words are more ambiguous. These words could also be deleted if they are above some threshold value on both DTMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing n-grams of at least 2 terms each may also be useful - one would expect many repeated negative word combinations in the bad review corpus (like 'not good' or 'not working'). As the terms are counted individually, this context is lost leading to increased positive words in the bad set and vice versa. Implementing n-grams would also aid in the analysis portion, providing more insight into the data."
