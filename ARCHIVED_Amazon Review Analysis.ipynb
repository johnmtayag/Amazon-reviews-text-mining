    "### Analysis of the data and Rating prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze customer reviews of different headphones listings on Amazon. The reviews will be split into \"good\" and \"bad\" sets, and the review texts will be processed into tokens consisting of individual words. These will form the \"good\" and \"bad\" review corpuses that will be analyzed to determine the most important words in either good and bad review sets. They will also be used to predict if a review will be \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis has many real-world applications. While customers can manually include ratings for the product in their reviews, this rating is only an overall statement"

Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic.

Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic.

    "###  Conclusions from the initial analysis of good/bad reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The most notable finding is that \"good\" is ranked as the most important term in both good and bad reviews. This is unexpected, considering that customers who leave bad reviews wouldn't normally conclude that the item was \"good.\" There are two likely reasons for this discrepancy\n",
    "* The bad reviews include 3-star reviews which fall in the middle of the spectrum - some aspects of the product may be good, but overall, the customer was disappointed\n",
    "* These reviews may be about how a product is actually \"not good\" instead of \"good\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting conclusion is how there are more important words in the bad review set than there are in the good review set (138 vs 114). Considering how the bad review set included only 34.4% of the total reviews, I would have expected fewer words in the bad review DTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation is that people tend to be more comprehensive when leaving bad reviews\n",
    "* Many good reviews focus on customer sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Just go for it\\n **Awesome best budget** wireless earphones\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    ">'**SUPERB**\\n **Sound quality is good**. noise cancellation is not upto the mark. **battery quality is decent**. by charging it once you can enjoy upto 5hrs of music without any issue\\n'\n",
    "* Bad reviews are often more detailed to emphasize discontent\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Honest review of an edm music lover\\n No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following **dissapointed** me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.**Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic**. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    ">'Review update - **Product failed after a few months**\\n Update: Sadly this is the **second Boat product to conk off after few months of use**. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, **not buying any more products from your brand**. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• **The sound is nothing great**, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. **The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird**. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• **Battery life is nothing to write home about** – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!\\n'\n",

    "### Adjusting the weights according to importance in good/bad reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the first issue where \"good\" seemed prominent in bad reviews, I will adjust the term weighting for shared terms. I will perform this adjustment on the final weight values for easier implementation as otherwise I would most likely need to formulate an entirely different weighting scheme and implement it on the DTM step.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will extract a list of all shared terms and multiply the good/bad weights by the proportion of the total weight in the good/bad DTM. For example, 'good' has 7868 weight in the good DTM and 2273 in the bad DTM. \n",
    "\n",

    "|Nice  |7868|2273|10141|\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation used to calculate the updated weights is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Weight_{new} = Weight * \\frac{Weight}{Total}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "By adding a weight to punish words shared between sets based on the relative proportion of total importance between sets, the resulting list of important words is much more indicative of review content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good reviews have a lot shared words at the top of the list ('good', 'best', 'product') while the bad reviews have more unique words at the top ('bad', 'worst', 'work').\n",
    "\n",
    "The good reviews mainly had words indicating customer sentiment, though there were a few words noting physical features ('sound', 'batteri', 'bass'). The bad reviews similarly had customer sentiment terms, but they included more words noting physical features. These include the aforementioned words from the good reviews, but also include words like 'mic', 'connect', 'call'. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting unique term from the top of the bad review DTM is 'month.' This is likely referring to the one month return policy on Amazon, or that the product may have stopped working after a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predicting Review Type\n",
    "\n",
    "To see if these extracted words can accurately predict whether a review is good or bad, I will build a model using the dataset. I will build an SVM model which is typically effective for text mining applications (especially when the feature count is very high).\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the work, I will not perform the weighting adjustment for words shared between good and bad reviews - for the SVM, this will require customizing a weighting scheme.\n",

    "The model performed fairly well with an overall 91.37% accuracy, though its accuracy for predicting bad reviews was much lower at 82\n",
    "58%. This is most likely due to the fact that there are only about half as many bad review examples as good review examples. Also, the term weights were not adjusted as in the earlier analysis -likely confusing the model. The model was much more successful at predicting good reviews with a 95.91% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix also shows that about twice as many instances were mistakenly classified as bad reviews than as good reviews, though this appears to correlate with there being twice as many good reviews than bad reviews. It also implies that some of these good reviews may contain content more associated with bad reviews than good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the model had relatively high marks, with an fscore for the good reviews of 93.62.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing n-grams of at least 2 terms each may also be useful in improving the model - one would expect many repeated negative word combinations in the bad review corpus (like 'not good' or 'not working'). As the terms are counted individually, this context is lost leading to increased positive words in the bad set and vice versa. Implementing n-grams would also aid in the analysis portion, providing more insight into what product qualities specifically that the user's are pointing out in their reviews."
